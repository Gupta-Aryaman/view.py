# Contributing

**Thanks for wanting to contribute to view.py!**

If you're like me and that fun feeling of seeing your name on that big contributors bar, or just like having your code run by other people, then this is the place for you.

Joining an open source project is hard, because well, code is messy, but I'm doing my best to try and make this as accessible to other developers as possible.

Be sure to read our contributor documentation for information on how to project works.

## Tooling

[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) is used as a means of project management, [SemVer](https://semver.org) for versioning, [MkDocs](https://mkdocs.org) for documentation, and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) for the changelog.

## What to work on?


Jumping right into a giant feature isn't a good idea, especially if you aren't familiar with the codebase. Now, if you have several hours of free time to spare and feel like trying to read the entire codebase, then go for it, but for my more lazy types, the [issues tab](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py/labels/beginner) has some good starts.

## How to work on it?

I get it, creating or assigning an issue is taking on a lot of pressure, especially that internal fear of "What if I can't get it done!"

For now, I don't really care if you create an issue or not, if you would like to just try and do one of these without any notice, go for it. I won't deny a working PR if it didn't have an issue associated with it.

Take it easy, coding is a fun activity, don't stress yourself out.

## I want to work on something bigger

You can either look on the issues tab or directly message me, I can divide up the work. Any help is good help, really.
