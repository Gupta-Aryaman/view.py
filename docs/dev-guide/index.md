# Development Guide

**Thanks for wanting to contribute to view.py!**

In this documentation, you'll learn all about the workflow of view.py development and all of its internal mechanisms.

Note that this documentation only provides information for files related to public features (so things like `compiler.py` and `_codec.py` that are not yet finished or public are not documented here).

## What is this for?

This documentation is to make life easier for aspiring contributors. If you don't want to read other peoples code, contributing to projects can be hard.

## Where can I get help?

If you need help, you should ask in [our discord](https://discord.gg/tZAfuWAbm2) or put something on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ZeroIntensity/view.py/issues). Both are checked regularly and will get you an answer to your question very quickly.
